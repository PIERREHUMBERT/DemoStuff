# IPAM lab environment
The Bicep file in this folder will setup a (very) simple lab environment for testing the new IPAM feature of Azure Virtual Network Manager.  
It will deploy the following resources:
* Virtual Network Manager (vnm-demoManager)
* Address Pool (ipamPool)
* Static CIDR block (OnPremCIDR)
* vNet (vnet-testnet1)

Currently, you will probably get some warnings when deploying this as the Bicep tools are not updated to include this new IPAM feature yet. But it works, have faith young padawan ðŸ‘Œ

Deploy the template to a resource group by running the following command:
```powershell
New-azResourceGroupDeployment -name IPAMDeployement -resourcegroupname <resourcegroupname> -templatefile .\main.bicep
```
