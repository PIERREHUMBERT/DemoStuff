# DemoStuff

Code used in my [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQI_069-AC_iU8Tw9nP-a3A) videoes is mostly stored here.  
Also stuff I do while live over on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/PetterTech) is stored here.  
And on the occasion I do something for a public speaking event, it will be here as well. Chances are, that is through [Sessionize](https://sessionize.com/petter-arnesen/).
